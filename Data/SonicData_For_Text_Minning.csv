"We had to send a drink and a burger back, and 15 minutes later, after pressing the button, we were told they ""forgot"" to bring our burger back. When they did... it was wrong.

"This is probably the worst sonic I've ever been to. Not just one occasion. It's consistently bad service. I only go here because it's the only sonic that's not 30+ minutes away. On one occasion I gave the cashier cash and a card to run. I told him to use the cash first. He then opens the door to give me back the cash and say ""oops I forgot"" . He ran my card for the full amount. I also love paying for items I never receive and drinking the flat sodas they give out ALL the time . Literally gonna start driving to the one 35 minutes away.

"No stars given. Absolutely horrendous the chicken was harder than my cutting board. The manager wanted to make another one, I passed. What I got belongs in the trash.

Very slow. Not sticking to the ticket. Asked for no tomatoes. Still I find tomatoes. Asked for ketchup and BBQ sauce WHEN I ORDERED.

I gave them another chance and they still managed to screw it up. Are there any adults working in this building? I called to speak with a manager because they messed up my order...again and the young guy who claimed to be the shift manager seriously asked me to come back up there with everything and the receipt. I asked if he could simply take my name and notate the items that were wrong and he got a nasty attitude and said that he would not entertain it. I spend at least 30 bucks each time my family comes and I am always dissatisfied and left regretting my decision. ¾I am done with this location.,1,3/4/17,4390,7739 EAST ILIFF AVENUE,"DENVER, CO¾ 80231",(303) 283-9598,Jeff Brock,jeff.brock@sonicpartnernet.com,(303) 619-0975
They managed to screw up my entire order. The sandwich had no cheese and it was dried up. The drink was wrong. The shake was wrong. I noticed the drink first and asked them to fix it. They brought the corrected drink and it was still wrong. There were a bunch of young people working and they looked annoyed that I brought up the errors in my order. I don't know what is going on at this location but they need better management.

"I don't typically expect too much out of a fast food joint, but there is no excuse for bad customer service. We ordered a couple of meals and asked for one to have a large coke and fry. The coke was large but the fry was small. So we pulled around and told them of the mistake expecting they'd bring out the correct size without any issues. Instead, a young girl came out and explained that ""even though it was rang incorrectly, you didn't pay for it, if you want it I'll have to charge you."" I don't mind paying for things but that is just terrible service. You should fix your mistakes NO QUESTIONS and make things right with your guests.

"I never leave bad reviews - I'm super laid back at restaurants and never complain or send my food back even if it's wrong. And I certainly don't expect much from fast food places. But this Sonic is SERIOUSLY AWFUL. For starters, the most I ever get is a drink and one time I wanted some tater tots, so my orders are never complicated or long. But somehow they still manage to get it wrong every time! They've left the vanilla out of my drink, given me the wrong size straw another time, gave me a small onion ring instead of a large tater tot and the onion rings tasted like a funnel cake, and the wait is always ridiculous. There's no winning here I swear, I'm done going to this location. I feel like I'm not alone in this decision either.

"Sonic provides the epitome of the American fast-food experience. You can drive up, order food, and stuff your face without ever leaving the comfort of your car. The menu is substantial with everything from fried, greasy, craving-inducing french fries and tater-tots to sugar-coma causing shakes and sundaes. If you're looking for fast, cheap, unhealthy eating at it's finest, you've found your place. It's been a couple of years since I've actually ordered a meal at a Sonic Drive In, but I do come with some frequency to enjoy a Vanilla Dr. Pepper or a Cherry Limeade. They have excellent ""happy hour"" deals and you can get a soda for cheap, cheap, cheap. I also enjoy their milkshakes (which, I believe, are half-priced after 8), though I can never eat more than a small without feeling like a blimp. They recently upgraded the signage with LCDs that display your order so you no longer have to wait for the poor employee on the other end of the intercom to read back a 17 item list, skipping over some small detail, only to correct them, reinitiating the entire process. Now, you can easily check your order on a screen making the whole interaction more streamlined and conducive to the ""fast""-food experience you'd expect. I'm surprised it took them so many years to do this. The experience you'll receive here is neither grandiose nor scrumptious and the food is mediocre with service to match. Healthy options are essentially non-existent and there's no culinary flare to be found. But that should be your expectation for a Sonic Drive In. It's americanized fast-food at it's finest and nothing more. The restaurant still has it's niche, though. It's great for after-concert soda refreshers or late-night sugar fixes. Occasionally the tater-tots or fries satisfy a need for sodium. So long as you set your expectations at the proper level for a visit to Sonic, you may find the experience to be quite fun.",4,3/19/16,5740,3555 QUEBEC STREET,"DENVER, CO¾ 80207",(303) 399-9500,Dora Simonds,simonds.dora@gmail.com,(303) 913-5943

"A fun alternative to traditional fast food Sonic allows you to pull up, order and get your food brought by a runner. As I didn't grow up during the heyday of drive-in restaurants Sonic is one of the only options in Denver. I stopped by yesterday 9/1/14 for a late afternoon snack. I tried the onion rings and large limeade while my girlfriend had a small malt (peanut butter fudge) and tater tots. The limeade was good and is made with actual limes (last time I went to Dairy Queen for a limeade they had stopped offering them :( ), the malt was thick and full of flavor and tater tots crispy and delicious. The onion rings? They had a weird batter that was almost sweet and even though it was crispy and hot I couldn't get over thinking it was more like a dessert onion ring (if that even exists) than a traditional one. I will not try them again but they have plenty of other options.",4,9/2/14,5740,3555 QUEBEC STREET,"DENVER, CO¾ 80207",(303) 399-9500,Dora Simonds,simonds.dora@gmail.com,(303) 913-5943
"We came here twice during our vacation in Colorado. Once for a quick bite of food and then returned to try their ice cream.  Sonic is fast food, so we were not expecting a gourmet meal, but what we were very surprised by was the service. First, our meal was delivered to our car in what felt like seconds. Both times, the staff was friendly and our order was perfect. I love Sonic's selection of slushies, their famous limeades and ice creams - So many options!

"This Sonic is hit or miss... Usually, the buns are super stale. Today was DEFINITELY my most disappointing visit, regarding service. It was quick, which is why I have 2 stars. First, the carhop asked me if I wanted my change back-- it was $.13, so I said no, then felt like an asshole 'tipping' a few cents, so gave her another $1- my total was only $3.87, so she essentially got a 33% tip. I took a bite of my cheeseburger, no cheese! She came back to my car, asked what I ordered, then asked if I wanted a whole new burger... (I'd taken 2 bites). ¾Ummmmm, .....??? I said they could just put cheese on it, thinking surely someone would tell her that wasn't appropriate... ¾She brought me back my original burger with unmelted cheese hanging out all over-- in her bare hands that have been handling money all day....

"This location was ok... i have visited other locations and had high expectations of this one. It was sad that they didnt meet it.

I tell him I just placed my order and they were missing an item then the guy gives me the price for the missing item because the cashier forgot to ring it up... okay then he ask me to see my reciept to make sure he didnt ring it up and I was like well your cashier mever gave me one... he questions if I was sure...

"The first time I came here was after hearing some horrible news that really got me emotionally down and exhausted. Having been on a strict diet for a while I had not eaten fast food or any kind of fatty dessert in quite some time. I thought I deserved a pick-me-up so I came for a medium sized pineapple milkshake that was made with real pineapple chunks. I also tried their chicken sandwich which reminded me of Jack In the Box's chicken sandwich (except not spicy). I was literally in tears in while in the parking lot which is why it was so convenient that I could sit in my car and wait for my shake to be brought out to me rather than go inside and face people. I felt much better after that gluttonous outing. I don't recommend that everyone stress eat or relieve their depressions with ice cream and fried chicken but HEY, I say it is warranted if it's a once in a while occurrence.

"I found this experience very troubling. While placing my order I was informed the credit card machine was broken and they could only accept cash. Understanding that sometimes that happens I didn't think twice. I got to the window to pay for my order and was told they had no coins to give me my change back from paying in cash. There wasn't enough change for bills or I would've demanded they up my change to an even dollar. I got home to eat my order and found that my jalapeno poppers had no ranch dipping and our shakes were pain vanilla ice cream. We ordered a peanut butter shake and a banana cream pie shake. Both had whipped cream on top but after digging in we realized it was just ice cream, not a single bit of peanut butter or banana in either. I'm furious that my order wasn't correct!

"I tried onion rings, cheddar poppers (jalape_o poppers) & a mini wild berry lavender creamery (new milkshake flavor topped with butter cookie and whipped cream). Their other new flavor is bourbon cream. I love everything lavender from lavender tea, lavender cupcakes, lavender macaroons to lavender laundry detergent, lavender candles and lavender hand soap. Extra star to sonics (of all places!) to be the first to have a lavender milkshake! I was skeptical but it tasted awesome. It wasn't overwhelmingly powerful in lavender flavor but there was definitely enough for you to identify it. It is a flavor added on a vanilla base I believe. Their onion rings are cooked longer than most places so it's harder (in a negative way) and crunchier. The jalape_o poppers tasted great but aren't very spicy at all (like most jalape_o poppers).

Didn't even let us explain that we were waiting on drinks that were paid for. During our lovely visit we saw one guy worker get into a car with his change dispenser still on him and take a ride around the parking spaces with his friends.

Most definitely won't be coming back to this location again.,1,10/16/16,3797,18535 SMOKY HILL ROAD,"AURORA, CO¾ 80015",(303) 766-3300,Dora Simonds,simonds.dora@gmail.com,(303) 913-5943
First of all the order was wrong. I had to take my son's burger in and get them to fix it. They put so much mustard on it that it was dripping off the sides and it was so disgusting he couldn't eat it. I even tried to wipe the mustard off but everything was saturated with it.

"I left this Sonic saying to myself ""I am never coming back to this location"" The food you receive here is your typical fast food restaurant quality, nothing special. The customer service you receive here is absolutely TERRIBLE. Earlier today we went and bought a sausage breakfast burrito, and a breakfast sandwich. The person who brought out our food said okay and took the food back in, but handed us our burrito. A female worker (maybe like a junior manager?) came out and tried to solve our problem, at this time my son who was eating the burrito tasted bacon rather than sausage and requested a new one. The worker straight up told us we were wrong and they don't serve sausage burritos. What? The menu said Jr. Sausage Burrito? After we pointed out the menu shows they do serve this type of burrito, she just walked away and went inside and grabbed a manager, and the right food. The manager came out and had the right food, but rather than just handing us the food he had to irritate us some more. He said ""Did you guys order a burrito?"" then we said ""Yes"". so he handed it to us. He then made us throw away our old burrito and then asked us if we ordered the sandwich. We said yes and he gave us that as well. He then saw the other burrito through the window and blamed me for eating it and said I would no longer receive my sandwich? The manager asked for the messed up burrito, and right in front of our eyes he just threw it away. Why couldn't we finish it? He then went on to tell me to hand him my sandwich so he can throw that away too since I already had the burrito, even though I did not eat the burrito, I told him no because I did not want the sandwich to be thrown away and I ordered the sandwich at a much higher cost and even if I did eat the burrito I still deserve to have the sandwich I ordered rather than it being thrown away. He finally stopped asking for the sandwich and him and the female worker walked inside. First of all this is not how you should treat your customers, if you mess up you should correct the mistakes you made right? Also what difference does it make if I have the food or the trashcan gets the food? Part of me thinks they wanted it back so they could re-serve the sandwich or eat it themselves. I used to love this sonic and would go here all the time back when the previous owner owned this restaurant, I will never be back here again, and unless you want to leave feeling mistreated I advise for you not to go back either.",1,3/4/17,3797,18535 SMOKY HILL ROAD,"AURORA, CO¾ 80015",(303) 766-3300,Dora Simonds,simonds.dora@gmail.com,(303) 913-5943

Recently stopped in at this location after a long day of fishing with the family. In general this location seems clean and friendly. As a whole company I'm very disappointed. My family does not drink soda and pricing out the meals versus getting the entree and toys separate was basically the same. As I was ordering our dinner I noticed I was being charged extra for the water. I asked if they were doing bottles and they said no. How is it that I am being charged extra for water versus soda! My husband decided to get a Coke and there was no charge. This is absolutely ridiculous to me! And when I asked they made it sound like I was crazy for thinking it's absurd.

But, I vaguely recall the servers delivering your food on roller skates back in the day? Maybe I'm an old geezer now and that's a thing of the past, but if you're expecting that, then don't. It was probably a safety hazard anyway. What's worthwhile at sonic though, in my opinion, are the slushees!

"MY review of Sonic will be just a little different from others here. I grew up with Sonic and I know it for what it is. It is a drive-in. It (the entire chain) has always been ""hit or miss"" and the several times I have eaten at the Sonic here in Brighton, I have had no complaints. I order the food. They make the food. I eat the food. Been the same since the 70s for me. I rarely have ""high"" expectations of ANY Fast Food place, so there isn't much I can be upset about. Having stated that - I normally get a burger and onion rings along with a drink. 9 times out of 10 the food is freshly made and tasty. However, every now and again, it is not so good. I truly believe, however, that having eaten at Sonics in Texas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, etc, it's about par for the course. My one big complaint is about the chain itself.

She didn't say a word to me, ¾just handed me the bag and walked away. ¾I will never come to this Sonic location ever again.",1,6/30/14,4426,15120 BRIGHTON ROAD,"BRIGHTON, CO¾ 80601",(720) 685-9501,Jeff Brock,jeff.brock@sonicpartnernet.com,(303) 619-0975
"This is the worst fast food place I have ever been too. Their customer services is horrible, food comes out non cooked. I'm going to get in contact with someone who can do something about this place. If this was my restaurant I would terminate all the employees and start over because non of them seem to care.",1,10/26/14,4426,15120 BRIGHTON ROAD,"BRIGHTON, CO¾ 80601",(720) 685-9501,Jeff Brock,jeff.brock@sonicpartnernet.com,(303) 619-0975
"Not sure why so many hate on this place--i've eaten there dozens of times in the last five years and never had a bad experience. ¾usually the staff is fine, not super perky, nor disgruntled, but fine.  Orders have almost always been accurate--there were a couple times they forgot to hold the lettuce on my wife's burger when asked, but that's the worst that has happened. ¾¾I like their supersonic cheeseburger better than anything from the other fast food places in brighton--wendy's, jack-in-the-box, etc...the green chili burger is also great. i always get the tater-tots rather than the fries, so i cannot comment on them, but the tots are great--always hot and crispy and yummy. I generally go for lunch, or occasionally late at night, so maybe the dinner rush time is where they're falling down if all these other reviews are accurate. ¾I don't know, but they have my recommendation.",4,6/24/15,4426,15120 BRIGHTON ROAD,"BRIGHTON, CO¾ 80601",(720) 685-9501,Jeff Brock,jeff.brock@sonicpartnernet.com,(303) 619-0975
Absolutely horrible service. Every single time I've been there they screw up my order. Last last night they screwed up again so my mother in law went back to get what was missing and they gave her a chip and told her that she'd could get whatever drink she wanted fir lifetime. Well I went to use it today and they refused to give it back! ¾Do not go here just a bunch of kids that work there with no customer service skills!,1,9/9/15,4426,15120 BRIGHTON ROAD,"BRIGHTON, CO¾ 80601",(720) 685-9501,Jeff Brock,jeff.brock@sonicpartnernet.com,(303) 619-0975
"Can I do zero stars? Tonight, the fries in our chili cheese fries were not even fully cooked. Sending them back now for a refund. Done with this location. I'll try Ft Lupton and see if it's any better. A little further to drive, but at least it isn't the Sonic in Brighton, Colorado.",1,10/4/14,4426,15120 BRIGHTON ROAD,"BRIGHTON, CO¾ 80601",(720) 685-9501,Jeff Brock,jeff.brock@sonicpartnernet.com,(303) 619-0975
"Really bad service and always something missing or you can't order, the only reason we still come is kids don't understand stupidity!
